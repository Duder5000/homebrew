### Curse Technique: Alkaline Manipulation (pH > 7)

**Name:** Alkaline Dominion

**Description:** The user manipulates and generates basic (alkaline) substances to attack, defend, and alter the environment. This technique is highly effective against acidic attacks and can cause severe chemical burns and degradation.

#### Abilities:

1. **Caustic Wave:**
   - The user releases a wave of highly alkaline liquid that can corrode and dissolve materials upon contact. This attack is particularly effective against metals and organic matter.
   - **Example:** The user summons a torrent of caustic liquid that sweeps across the battlefield, melting obstacles and harming enemies caught in its path.

2. **Alkaline Barrier:**
   - The user creates a protective barrier composed of basic energy, neutralizing incoming acidic attacks and providing a strong defense against physical and chemical threats.
   - **Example:** When an enemy launches an acidic projectile, the user raises an alkaline shield that neutralizes the acid on contact, rendering the attack harmless.

3. **Corrosive Mist:**
   - The user disperses a fine mist of alkaline particles that can cause chemical burns and respiratory damage to enemies. This mist lingers in the air, creating a hazardous environment.
   - **Example:** In a confined space, the user fills the area with an alkaline mist, forcing enemies to either flee or suffer from its corrosive effects.

4. **Alkaline Transmutation:**
   - The user can transmute substances into their basic forms, weakening structures and weapons by increasing their pH levels. This can cause materials to become brittle and break easily.
   - **Example:** The user touches a metal weapon, transmuting its surface to an alkaline state, causing it to rust and crumble in the opponent's hands.

### Curse Technique Reversal: Acidic Manipulation (pH < 7)

**Name:** Acidic Vengeance

**Description:** By reversing the properties of their Alkaline Dominion, the user gains control over acidic substances. This technique focuses on destruction and corrosion, leveraging the harmful nature of acids.

#### Abilities:

1. **Acidic Surge:**
   - The user generates a powerful burst of acid that can melt through defenses and cause severe damage to enemies. The intensity and range of this attack depend on the amount of reversed energy used.
   - **Example:** The user unleashes a concentrated stream of acid that can cut through walls and armor, reaching enemies hiding behind obstacles.

2. **Corrosive Armor:**
   - The user envelops themselves in a layer of acidic energy, which corrodes anything that comes into direct contact with them. This serves as both a defensive and offensive mechanism.
   - **Example:** When an opponent attempts to strike the user, their weapon begins to dissolve upon contact with the corrosive armor, deterring further attacks.

3. **Acid Rain:**
   - The user creates a localized storm that rains
