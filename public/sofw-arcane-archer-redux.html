            <p>
              At 3rd level, a fighter gains the Martial Archetype feature. Here is a special homebrew option for that feature: <em>Arcane Archer Redux</em>.</br>
              An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.

            <em>3rd-level Arcane Archer Redux feature</em></br>
            At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature, typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition.</br>
            You gain one of the following options:
            <ul class="list-opts">
              <li class="list-opts">Proficiency in the Arcana skill and 1 cantrip from the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/class/wizard?filter-search=&filter-level=0&filter-verbal=&filter-somatic=&filter-material=&filter-concentration=&filter-ritual=&filter-sub-class=">Wizard spell list</a></li>
              <li class="list-opts">Proficiency in the Nature skill and 1 cantrip from the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/class/wizard?filter-search=&filter-level=0&filter-verbal=&filter-somatic=&filter-material=&filter-concentration=&filter-ritual=&filter-sub-class=">Druid spell list</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your chosen cantrip.

          <h2 id="arcane-shot">Arcane Shot</h2>
          <p>
            <em>3rd-level Arcane Archer Redux feature</em></br>
            At ard level, when you attack with a shortbow or longbow, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.</br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Additoanlly, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#ArcaneShotOptions-682" target="_blank">Arcane Shot Options</a> or <a href="#additional-shots">Additional Arcane Shot Options</a>).</br>
            Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits a creature, unless the option doesn’t involve an attack roll. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your intelligence modifier, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.</br>
            If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</br>
            You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.

            <em>7th-level Arcane Archer Redux feature</em></br>
            At 7th level, when you attack with a shortbow or longbow, the attack counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

          <p>
            <em>7th-level Arcane Archer Redux feature</em></br>
            At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.

            <em>15th-level Arcane Archer Redux feature</em></br>
            Starting at 15th level, your magical archery is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.

            <em>18th-level Arcane Archer Redux feature</em></br>
            The effect of each Arcane Shot is improved as described in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#ArcaneShotOptions-682" target="_blank">Arcane Shot Options</a> or <a href="#additional-shots">Additional Arcane Shot Options</a>.

          <p>
            <em>Hail of Arrows</em></br>
            You imbue your arrow with transmutation magic, causing copies of your arrow to be created from it as it flies, allowing you to hit any creature within 5ft of your original target. However, damage rolls are resolved separately.</br>
            At 18th level in this class you can hit any creature within 10ft of your original target.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Elemental Arrows</em></br> 
            As a Bonus Action, you can use one of your Arcane Shots to enhance your bow with elemental power. Choose the elemental type from the following list each time you activate this feature, Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. For the next minute each arrow you loose deals an additional 1d6 damage of the selected type. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).</br>
            At 18th level in this class your Elemental Arrows now explode on hit. One a successful hit, all creatures within 5th of your target also take the additional elemental damage. Additionally, when you score a critical hit, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.
