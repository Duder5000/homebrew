            <li>
              <b>Legendary Resistance:</b></br>
               Once per day, if you fail a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

              Once per long rest as an action you can change the appearance of one or more creatures, as the <em class="class-spells">Seeming</em> spell. Any creature that succeeds on a Wisdom save to disbelieve (and thus see through) the glamour takes 5d6 points of psychic damage.

              <em>Prerequisite: Chromatic Category</em></br>
              Your breath weapon loses its normal energy type and  you create five different breath weapons simultaneously: a cone of acid, a cone of cold, a cone of fire, a line of acid, and a line of lightning. Each breath weapon deals damage equal to half your normal breath weapon damage dice (rounded down), and each one allows a Dexterity save to halve the damage dealt. When you use this breath effect, you also take a number of points of damage equal to your warlock level, which can’t be lessened by damage reduction or any similar benefit.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Discorporating Breath of Bahamut:</b></br>
              <em>Prerequisite: Metallic Category</em></br> 
               Your breath weapon loses its normal energy type and becomes a blue-white line of pure energy. This breath effect doubles the number of dice of damage normally dealt by your breath weapon. In addition, any creature that is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by the breath weapon is disintegrated (as the <em class="class-spells">Disintegrate</em> spell). A successful Constitution save halves the damage dealt. Unlike disintegrate, this breath effect has no effect on objects, even those made of force. When you use Discorporating Breath of Bahamut, you also take a number of points of damage equal to your warlock level, which can’t be lessened by damage reduction or any similar benefit. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Psycho-concussive Breath of Sardior</b></br>
              <em>Prerequisite: Gem Category</em></br> 
              Your breath weapon loses its normal energy type and becomes a colorless 15ft cone that deals Force damage equal to the normal number of dice dealt by your breath weapon. Additionally, any creature in the area must make an Intelligence save or take Psychic damage equal to the normal number of dice dealt by your breath weapon and become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a success they take no Psychic damage nor are they frightened. When you use Psycho-concussive Breath of Sardior, you also take a number of points of damage equal to your warlock level, which can’t be lessened by damage reduction or any similar benefit.
