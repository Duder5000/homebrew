              <b>Ideation Process:</b> </br>
              The first activity was called the “Say & Play”. It was a pre-assigned task to find 3 precedent games that interest you as a designer and bring them to the table. We all took turns sharing them as this activity acted as both our introductions to each other. We once again looped back to our initial conversations and defined more restrictions/considerations for our project's scope. 
              The second activity was called the “Vision Board”. We as a group wrote down many prompts across a variety of topics to use as inspiration for our next ideation activity. The first image is a glance of our inspiration wall.
              The third activity was called “Crazy 8’s”. This resulted at the end was 8 different ideas each.
              The fourth activity was “Dotting”. We would each take turns sharing the concepts to the rest of the group. Meanwhile others would listen and without a limit on Dots, everyone would place dots on cells they find interesting. 
              The final activity was “Design Booths”. The goal of this activity was for everyone to independently consolidate the ideas the team finds popular. The first being the placing coloured dots on key ideas you would like to design with as a form of preparing your workstation. The second phase was for everyone to create their own game pitch from the concepts the team had collectively deemed interesting. 
              After all designs had been made we discussed the 4 ideas and picked 1 for the project.
              We then filled in the game proposal based on the outcome of the ideation activities.

              This week's journal is pretty much the same as the team one this week, this week was almost entirely ideation and then writing the proposal document.
              I don't have anything else to say, without putting in meaningless filler.

              <b>Brief Summary:</b></br>
              During the third week,we finalized details about the game’s mechanics, enemies, & tower types for our game. In the fourth week, our programmers started to build a simple version of a tower defense game for testing while the visual artist began to design the characters for the gameworld. In addition, our PM refined and prepared the Game Design Document for presentation. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>My Contributions:</b></br>
              I worked on the brain storming, finalization, & GDD alone with everyone else.I started the third week by looking for Unity tutorials for tower defense games (tutorials that I watched most / all of are linked below). I spent the rest of the third week & the fourth week working through the tutorial that I thought would work best. Talked with Jermey during week four to decide whose tutorial base to start working from (we decided to work from Jermey’s), then we started to make changes & additions to prep for the week five playtest.
            </p> 
            <p>
              <b>Reflection:</b></br>
              Mostly just problems related to getting lost in video tutorials, some of which are several years old, solving most of them through researching misbehaviours or error codes in the code. Scraping & trying to re-work thought parts that I could not solve with researching.

              Over the past 2 weeks I watched/read tutorials and worked on code for...
              Building the base for the day/night timer</br>
              Placing towers in fornt of the player charcter</br>
              Building the Magnifier (fire) tower & its damage releated to how heated up the fire is</br>
              Prevent towers front attacking enemies not withing a torch's range</br>
              Enemies drop components, that are used for a currency system</br>
              Build wave spawning base</br>
              Started work on the system for harvesting resources

              Over the past view weeks, I started by adding our torch (light) system for receiving & placing them and etuping a pause sytem & did some fixes to our magnifier/fire tower from the previous weeks.</br>
              Then I made the wave spawning system & setup a few waves for testing.</br>
              The next group of things I worked on was the shop & tower placemnet system.</br>
              The rest of the week was fixing bugs & more enemies / wave work.

              I started to implemnet the new tower (magnet/slowing & collector), inistaion setup for the tower upgrades, the first pass on the following/tracking enemy, along with alot of bug fixing </br>
              The collector tower easy to implement the collecting of the dropped componets, the problem I ran into was being able to take the compoents value stored in the tower & give it to the player. I did not solve this for this week & as such will follow-up on it in the flowing week(s).</br>
              The magnet tower is modifed basic tower (pebble pounder / sniper towers), that just shoot a diffrent projectile. The problem I ran into was getting that projectile created properly. After talking to the TA, I added an enum for the projectile, along with an overriden Create function to handle the alterative version of the projectile. </br>
              I coded in the function of the tower upgrades & created the arrays the defined what the upgrade paths would be, but I ran into a similar problem as with the collector tower, not being able to interface with the tower as the player to tell it to do an upgrade. Similarly to the collector tower I've left this for the  flowing week(s). </br>
              I implemented the enemy pathing from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvtFUfJ6CP8&t=146s">2D PATHFINDING - Enemy AI in Unity</a> tutorial for our following/tracking enemy. I have yet to implement the effects of the enemy when it reaches the player and Jeremy is handling spawning this enemy. </br>
              The rest of the weeks was working on errors, bugs, and reading/watching Unity tutorials.

              These weeks were focused on fixing the bugs & partially implemented features from the last few weeks. </br>
              I met with the TA to talk about my problems with the collector tower & the tower upgrades. It ended up being a simple fix by using <code>.GetComponent</code> on the GameObject I had stored. He also let me know this is an expensive bit of code, but see as we are near the end of this course I opted to use it rather than needing to re-write alot of code.</br>
              I contuined to work on the following/tracking enemy, making it slow down the player for a short time when the collied, which can be reduced if the player goes into light.</br>
              The rest of my time was spent solving errors & trying to fix bugs.
