              <b>Ideation Process:</b> </br>
              The first activity was called the “Say & Play”. It was a pre-assigned task to find 3 precedent games that interest you as a designer and bring them to the table. We all took turns sharing them as this activity acted as both our introductions to each other. We once again looped back to our initial conversations and defined more restrictions/considerations for our project's scope. 
              The second activity was called the “Vision Board”. We as a group wrote down many prompts across a variety of topics to use as inspiration for our next ideation activity. The first image is a glance of our inspiration wall.
              The third activity was called “Crazy 8’s”. This resulted at the end was 8 different ideas each.
              The fourth activity was “Dotting”. We would each take turns sharing the concepts to the rest of the group. Meanwhile others would listen and without a limit on Dots, everyone would place dots on cells they find interesting. 
              The final activity was “Design Booths”. The goal of this activity was for everyone to independently consolidate the ideas the team finds popular. The first being the placing coloured dots on key ideas you would like to design with as a form of preparing your workstation. The second phase was for everyone to create their own game pitch from the concepts the team had collectively deemed interesting. 
              After all designs had been made we discussed the 4 ideas and picked 1 for the project.
              We then filled in the game proposal based on the outcome of the ideation activities.

              Journal is pretty much the same as the team one this week, this week was almost entirely ideation and then writing the proposal document.
              I don't have anything else to say, without putting in meaningless filler.
