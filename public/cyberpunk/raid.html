            <h2 id="2023">Welcome to 2023</h2>
            <p class="spell-desc">
              In the far future of 2023, you’re covertly contacted to be part of a world-changing event.
              <br/>
              Your contact? Either Morgan Blackhand, Johnny Silverhand, or Santiago Aldecaldo. Whoever reached out, they picked you because you're the best at what you do. But there’s a catch: you’ll know nothing about the job until you accept, and if you leak anything, death would be a mercy compared to what’s coming.
              <br/>
              Once you accept, you’re pulled into a world of secrets and shadows, where every move is under watch and allies are few. You’ll be running on a razor’s edge, with Arasaka breathing down your neck and a target painted on your back. In this fight, every second matters, and the line between life and death blurs. The truth finally hits: you’re here to take Arasaka down a peg or two.

            <p class="spell-desc">
              <em>"I see corps… transforming Night City into a machine fueled by crushed spirits, broken dreams, and emptied pockets. Corps have controlled our lives long enough—taken too much. And now, they’re after our souls. I’m declaring war not because capitalism’s a thorn in my side, or out of nostalgia for an America that’s gone. This is a people’s war against a system that's spiraled out of control."</em>
              <br/><br/>
              Johnny didn’t just pick you out of a lineup. He’s seen your work and knows you can go the distance. To him, you’re the one who can break through corporate chains and bring his vision for a free Night City one step closer.

            <p class="spell-desc">
              <em>"This isn’t about revenge or some rockstar’s crusade. This is about balance. Arasaka’s been stacking the deck too long, breaking the rules while making their own. A corp like that needs a lesson—not just a hit, but a reminder of what real power looks like when it’s not bought and sold. I don’t care about the mess, and I don’t need the glory. I just need to know that when the dust settles, they’ll think twice before stepping on someone who pushes back."</em>
              <br/><br/>
              Morgan chose you because he knows you’re not here for glory or revenge—you’re here to get the job done. He sees in you the grit and discipline that it’ll take to make Arasaka hurt where it counts.

            <p class="spell-desc">
              <em>"We’re not hitting Arasaka for kicks or creds, chumba. This is about making a damn point. They’ve taken too much from us—from everyone trying to live without selling their soul to a corp. They need to know we’re still here, that family, loyalty, and grit mean more than anything they’ll ever understand. It’s a message. One they won’t forget, even if it’s the last thing we leave 'em with."</em>
              <br/><br/>
              Santiago didn’t pick you by accident. He chose you because you understand what family and loyalty mean—and because he trusts you’ll hit Arasaka hard enough to make them feel it. He believes you’ll fight for a cause that goes deeper than any payday.

            <p class="spell-desc">
              This job isn’t just a score. When Arasaka falls, the aftershocks will change Night City—and maybe you—forever. You’re about to make history, for better or worse.
              <br/>
              Getting in is one thing. Getting out? Another. The deeper you go, the harder it’ll be to find the light at the end of this corporate labyrinth. In the end, the real victory might just be making it out alive.
