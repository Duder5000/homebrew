						For iteration 1 I started by looking through the Neil Squire site. I ended up choosing an <a href="https://www.makersmakingchange.com/s/blog-article/a33JR0000009mWrYAI/accessible-wallet ">accessible wallet</a> idea. It just happened to be the post that caught my eye.  It was a request for a wallet that was easier to use with weaker fine motor skills.
					</p>       
					<p class="spell-desc">
						I originally did the persona worksheet as a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lylvwPChwCyx993AqmNiLj0kGgB9jkGGiBHFQE5OLSY/edit">point list</a>, but you can see the reformatted sheet below.
					</p>
					<p class="spell-desc">
						<b>Materials:</b> I am going with primarily plastic for my design with wood as secondary. 
					</p> 					
					<p class="spell-desc">
						The sketch / idea that Ken & I decided would be the best to proceed with is shown below, the rest can be seen <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Bkqci7BNsGL-ZZsaZ6QnKXY7XZagbKK5">here</a>. We agreed that it was the most interesting without being too complex. </br>
						<em>Note: I had a hard time adding shading, I hope this was close enough.</em>

						Below is a picture of my cardboard model. I switched to doing an angled opening for the cards based on the feedback from Ken. I used a cut done bold for the pivot, which causes some problems for testing it because it sticks out more than I would like, but I think it is good enough to get the point across.

						<b>List of Technology:</b> I don't think there is really anything that I could use. It will entirely be 3D printed with a 3D printed or found plastic pivot/pin, unless I can find a metal insert to

					<h2 id="3rd">3rd Iteration</h2>
					<p class="spell-desc">
						I started modeling the wallet in OnShape based on my sketch, Ken's feedback, & measurements from my wallet. I watched some tutorials (listed below as well as a few others in the same series as the linked tutorials) to help me figure out how OnShape works as I have only used Solidworks before & I haven't done so for several years. 
						My OnShape files <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/791783222c6afa5436920c25/w/89bcbdf29ba9608c4bfe182e/e/773610ca01da87b4242f5ad9?renderMode=0&uiState=66371f702da8ea0cdcba4947">is here</a>.

					<h4>Material Ideas</h4>
					<p class="spell-desc">
						I have 3 primary for the material of the body of the wallet. The first is just simple matte black plastic.
						The 2nd is a similar material to the first, but has texturing that makes it easier to grip. I'm not exactly sure what specific type of plastic it would be, but I would like something similar to the OnePlus Sandstone texture.
						The 3rd / exotic material is carbon fiber.
						Additonally, the wallet could have RFID blockers added into the material, possible only with the carbon fiber becuase of the added cost.</br>

						Lastly, I could use something as simiple as cup head bolt to connect the card holders or a pivot machined spefficly for it.</br>
