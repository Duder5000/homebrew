**Founders Realization**
When the Founder drank the blood of the Sun’s Son, he tasted divinity for a split second. After the Sun ripped away his divinity and cursed him to become the first vampire, the Founder drank the blood of monster, but when he first drank the blood of a sentient person, he tasted a fraction of the same power as the divinity. He realized that there is divine potential scattered and hidden across mortal races. He took over a settlement and made it into a city. He built a hierarchy for the sole purpose of accumulating the divine potential at the top of the food chain. The vampires fed on mortals, noble vampires fed on vampires, royalty fed on nobility, and the Founder fed on royalty. With each transaction of blood, nfinitesimally small traces pf divinity were transferred to the top predator from the mortals who were at the bottom of the food chain. That’s why he refused every proposal forbidding vampires to feed on vampires. He is trying to achieve divinity because he thinks that he can do a better job than the current deities. He justifies his cruel actions by defending their necessity and he wants to make them right once he becomes a deity.
