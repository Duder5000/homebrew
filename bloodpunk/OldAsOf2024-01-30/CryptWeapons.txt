**Prototype Bloodwork Exosuit Core**
*Armor (half-plate), Very Rare (requires attunement)*
A prototype of the bloodwork exosuit now exclusively used by the most respected commanders in Cyherested.
The suit operates with a blood tank filled with your own blood. When you first attune to the bloodwork exosuit, your hit point maximum decreases by an amount equal to your level. This reduction lasts until you are no longer attuned to the exosuit.
While attuned to the exosuit, you gain the following benefits:
- Your Strength score becomes 17 if it is not higher than that already. 
- Whenever you are subjected to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage that you take from nonmagical attacks it is reduced by 2.
- Bloodwork Launcher: You can launch blood projectiles from the suit by using your own blood. As a bonus action reduce your maximum HP by 1 for each projectile. The projectiles act as a Magic Missile spell, but dealing blood damage instead of force damage. You regain your maximum HP when you complete a long rest.
- Modern pieces of Bloodwork Enhancements can be added to this prototype by a skilled Artificer.

**Ornate Angst Longsword**
Angst weapons are crafted with a cavity in the middle of them, which is later filled with angst. This angst is connected to the hilt with tiny tubes, and the spiked hilt of the weapon has a space in which a *Blood Cartridge* can be inserted. There is a button on the back of the hilt to move the blood in the cartridge through the angst, which ejects the cartridge afterwards, making room for a new one.
- You can take a bonus action to push the button and activate the weapon. Once activated, your successful weapon attacks made with the angst weapon deal an extra 2d6 fire damage for 1 minute.
- In case you lack blood shells, you can squish the spiked hilt as a bonus action, which drains your blood. You take 1d12 piercing damage that canâ€™t be reduced by any means, and the weapon is activated in the same way described above.
- Attacks made with angst weapons are magical owing to the nature of the angst crystals. The magical properties of this weapon keep working in areas devoid of magic, such as an area affected by the antimagic field spell, again, owing to the nature of the angst.
