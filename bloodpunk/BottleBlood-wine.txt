**Celestial Blood:** With its strong sweet flavor and a hint of acidity, celestial blood is an acquired taste to be sure. If you drink celestial blood without the celestial’s consent, you must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you are immune to celestial blood’s side effects for 24 hours. On a failed save, you die immediately.
When you consume 50 hit points worth of celestial blood, you become immune to diseases and regain1d4 + 1 hit point at the start of each of your turns until you finish a long rest.

**Fiend Blood:** The blood of fiends is acidic and very bitter, and it has a burning magical nature. When you drink the blood of a fiend for the first time in 24 hours, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) acid and 7 (2d6) fire damage. 
When you consume 10 hit points worth of fiend blood, you are immune to either fire or poison damage (determined by the GM) until you finish a long rest.

**Giant Blood:** A giant’s blood pressurizes the veins in the consumer’s body, making them visible through the skin. It tastes salty.
When you consume 10 hit points worth of giant blood, your Strength score increases by 2 for 1 hour. Also, you can use weapons that are one size category larger than you without any penalties for the duration.

**Ooze Blood:** One must use a process similar to the extraction of construct blood in order to harvest the blood of an ooze. Their fake blood is more slimy than that of a construct and has more of a savory taste.
When you consume 15 hit points worth of false ooze blood, you can elongate your limbs for 1 hour. Your reach increases by 5 feet for the duration.

**Plant Blood:** Just like constructs and oozes, plants have false blood. The false blood of a plant is sweet and sour, and has an adhesive nature.
When you consume 20 hit points worth of false plant blood, your skin is covered with a thin layer of bark until you finish a long rest. You have a +1 bonus to AC for the duration.
