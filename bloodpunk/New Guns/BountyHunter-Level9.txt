**Hit ‘Em!**
Starting at 9th level, you ignore half cover while making weapon attacks with ranged bloodwork weapons.

**Tools of the Hunt**
When you reach 9th level, you become a notable bounty hunter in the region, and you gain both the knowledge and access to special tools and traps designed for bounty hunters called tools of the hunt, as well as ranged bloodwork weapon modifications. 
You can prepare a tool of the hunt, which is listed below, by working on each of them for 1 hour. You can prepare these tools during a short rest. Also, instead of preparing a new tool, you can modify ranged bloodwork weapons. To make any of these, you must have one tinker’s tools.
You can use a tool of the hunt as an action. Also, you can prepare traps using them. Preparing a trap takes 1 minute. You can also make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide the trap. A trap covers an area of 5-foot square. It is triggered when a creature moves 10 feet or closer to it, and the trap becomes useless if it is not triggered for 8 hours after it is set up. If a tool requires an attack roll, the trap prepared by it also requires it. In this case, you make an appropriate weapon attack when the trap is triggered.
While preparing tools of the hunt, you make an Intelligence check using tinker’s tools. If someone tries to disarm a trap prepared by this tool, or to disrupt its functions, it must make an Intelligence check using tinker’s tools or Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, which should be higher than your check to be successful.
Only two modifications can be attached to a ranged bloodwork weapon at a time. This number increases to three when you reach 13th level in this class. Preparing one modification and attaching it to the weapon takes 1 hour and requires 250 KF, along with tinker’s tools. Once a modification is attached to a weapon, it can be changed after another hour of work. Some of these modifications are ammunition (bullets). While a bullet is attached to a weapon as a modification, you can choose to use it or a normal bullet.
If a tool of the hunt requires a saving throw, the save DC for the saving throw is equal to 8 plus your proficiency bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. 
	Bloody Bolas. This is a bolas that has razors on it, which you can use to make ranged weapon attacks. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 piercing plus 2d4 slashing damage and must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained. The target can remove the bolas as an action, or another creature can spend its action to remove it. Huge or larger creatures can’t be restrained by this attack.

	Blood Bullets. You use your own blood while preparing this modification. You spend one or more Hit Dice by drawing your blood, and craft them into bullets. You can craft 12 bullets per Hit Die you spent. Making this modification doesn’t require any money.
	Explosive Bullets. You can craft 12 bullets that explode on impact. When you hit a creature with one, the bullet explodes and the target is wounded. A wounded creature has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.
	Extended Mag. You can craft a larger magazine for your ranged bloodwork weapon. The amount of ammunition that the weapon holds increases by half of what the normal size can hold.
	Handy Grip/Stock. You know your weapon well and it feels comfortable in your grip. You have advantage on ranged weapon attacks made with the bloodwork weapon to which this modification.
	Hollow-Point Bullets. You can craft 12 lethal bullets. You roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the damage of a successful attack with this bullet.
	Metal Stock. You can attach metal parts to the stock of a ranged bloodwork weapon. You can make a melee weapon attack with the weapon as a bonus action, which deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a success.
	Scope. You craft a special scope or enhance your weapon’s scope that doubles the range of your bloodwork weapon.
	Suppressor. Your attacks with the modified weapon become silent and harder to detect. The radius of the area of detection is halved as long as the suppressor is attached to the ranged bloodwork weapon.
