~~Blood God Speaks~~
	As you step through the portal, your vision is filled with incomprehensible magical energy. You have the sudden feeling that this is how an extremely powerful sorcerer invites you into his home. You're lost for a moment, overwhelmed by the raw magic. You float in this magical energy for a few seconds... minutes... days... an eternity.
	Then the sorcerous power is effortlessly batted aside, as crimson light fills this in-between plane, you watch as the Sun falls from where you're floating. As he winks out of your sight, an omni-present voice fill this bloody place.

	*"Two mighty contenders, shrouded in the enigma of destiny, stand at the precipice of conflict. Their paths entwined in the scarlet veil of fate, they transcend the confines of this plane. The verdict, not molded by their intentions, rests in the hands of newcomers to the unfolding drama. Yet, amid them, a trickster directs unseen maneuvers."*

	Each of you get the sense of an unbelievably powerful entity staring straight into your soul. 

	*"Tread carefully, young ones. Life courses through blood; death lies in its embrace. I am the origin, I am the conclusion."*

	**Harvey after:** "You interest me Chosen One. I hope you play the game well. There maybe an opening in my court for you sometime soon."

	**Aerin after:** "Good girl. You've ignored that pathetic so-called god's call for help. A god that needs help, is no god at all. I will be watching you with curiosity. There maybe an opening in my court for you sometime soon."

	**Azrael after:** Have you ever wondered why you were reborn when the skies first rained blood? When the time comes to decided... think about that. Will you revive him, to return to be my reluctant Hand? Or will you let him fade away in his failure and take your place at my side?
	[DO NOT SENT!] ||The godly power that the Founder stole, when the Sun god took it away, the Blood got hide some of it in other mortals before it could be returned.||

	**Except for the Sun**
	As you watch your companions leave your sight, an endless sea of blood appears below you... to plummet into it. 
	As you sink, the crimson sea blinds you, the sloshing of the bloody wave deafness you, the smell of decay anosmias (lose of smell) you, and the taste of copper ageusias (lose of taste) you. 
	It feels as if you've spent years in the blood... senseless. 
	Then you remember the one sense It left to you, but only as you feel the claws of blood rip into your body and pull you to bottom of this endless sea. You know you will soon reach the bottom... the end... the death. After how long you waited, is this how you go to the Sun God? 
	All of a sudden blinding sunlight, burns the sea away and strangely returns your senses. You awake, returned to a plane where your god still has influence. The light even as dim as it is, warms your soul. You feel a connection to the Sun God that you had forgot. As you open your eyes, you see a small portal to the Sun Vault. Sunlight begins to leak from the portal and forms a blade of solid sunlight on your broken sword.

	You are here alone of a few minutes before your companions arrive.
	You are on a metal surface. There is a large door made of varnished wood and frosted glass, decorated with bronze tubes and plates as well as engravings burned into the wood. There is a chill in the air.

	Awakening normally happens when a vampire has feed on enough sentient beings to realize the truth of the Founder's curse, that it allows a vampire to consume the divine potential scattered and hidden across mortals.

	**Founders Realization**
	When the Founder drank the blood of the Sun’s Son, he tasted divinity for a split second. After the Sun ripped away his divinity and cursed him to become the first vampire, the Founder drank the blood of monster, but when he first drank the blood of a sentient person, he tasted a fraction of the same power as the divinity. He realized that there is divine potential scattered and hidden across mortal races. He took over a settlement and made it into a city. He built a hierarchy for the sole purpose of accumulating the divine potential at the top of the food chain. The vampires fed on mortals, noble vampires fed on vampires, royalty fed on nobility, and the Founder fed on royalty. With each transaction of blood, nfinitesimally small traces pf divinity were transferred to the top predator from the mortals who were at the bottom of the food chain. That’s why he refused every proposal forbidding vampires to feed on vampires. He is trying to achieve divinity because he thinks that he can do a better job than the current deities. He justifies his cruel actions by defending their necessity and he wants to make them right once he becomes a deity.
