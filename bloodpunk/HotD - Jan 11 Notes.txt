__Blood God Speaks__
*As you step through the portal, your vision is filled with incomprehensible magical energy. As the magic washes over you, you have the sudden feeling that this is how an extremely powerful sorcerer invites you into his home. You're lost for a moment, overwhelmed by the raw magic. You float in this magical energy for a few seconds... minutes... days... weeks.*
*Then the sorcerous power is effortlessly batted aside, as crimson light fills this in-between plane, you watch as the Sun falls from where you're floating. As he winks out of your sight, as an omni-present voice fills this bloody place.*

"Two mighty contenders, shrouded in an enigma of destiny, stand at the precipice of conflict. Their paths entwined in the scarlet veil of fate, they transcend the confines of this plane. The verdict, not molded by their intentions, rests in the hands of newcomers to the unfolding drama. Yet, amid them, tricksters direct unseen maneuvers."

*Each of you get the sense of an unbelievably powerful entity staring straight into your soul.*

"Tread carefully, young ones. Life courses through blood; death lies in its embrace. I am the origin, I am the conclusion."

__Direct Messages__

**Aerin after:** "Good girl. You've ignored that pathetic god's call for help. A god that needs help, is no god at all. I will be watching you with curiosity. There may soon be an opening in my court. I hope you do not disapoint."

**Ethel:** Maulev (Alen) has had a revolation. I hope you get to speak with him about it... before I do.

**Azrael after:** Have you ever wondered why you too were changed for his orginal sin? When the time comes to decided his fate, think about it. Will you revive him, to return to be my reluctant Hand? Or will you let him fade away into his failure, then take your place at my side?
	DO NOT SENT: ||The godly power that the Founder stole, when the Sun god took it away, the Blood god hide some of it in other mortals before it could be returned.||
	Removed: ||Have you ever wondered why you were reborn when the skies first rained blood?||

__Except for the Sun__
As your companions fade from view, a boundless sea of blood materializes beneath you, and you find yourself hurtling towards its depths. The scarlet abyss envelops you, blinding your vision, deafening your ears with the relentless sloshing of the bloody tide, and robbing you of your sense of smell as the stench of decay pervades. The metallic taste of copper fills your mouth, and it seems like an eternity passes as you drift senselessly through the crimson currents.
Suddenly, amidst the sensory deprivation, a realization strikes you – the one sense that remains intact. Yet, before you can fully grasp the meaning, the claws of blood tear into your body, dragging you towards the abyss' unfathomable bottom. In the depths, a profound certainty settles in your soul – this is your journey's end, the embrace of death. After how long you waited, is this how you go to the Sun God?
Abruptly, blinding sunlight pierces through the sea of blood, incinerating it and restoring your senses. You awaken, finding yourself back in a realm where your god's influence holds sway. Even the subdued light warms your soul, rekindling a connection with the Sun God that had slipped from memory. As your eyes flutter open, a small portal to the Sun Vault appears, and sunlight spills forth, coalescing into a blade of solid radiance upon your shattered blade.
For a few solitary minutes, you stand alone before the arrival of your companions. The metallic surface beneath you spans 30 feet in every direction, surrounded by an expansive blue sky with the sun gradually rising on the horizon. Just before your comrades materialize through the portal, a colossal door emerges from the metal expanse, rising as if drawn from the depths of a lake. As it fully manifests, a chilling air permeates the surroundings, casting an eerie aura over the scene.

**Sun Vault (uncommon):** As a Bonus Action, you can conjure any weapon or tool of your choice, magical (*common, uncommon*) or nonmagical, into an empty hand. Weapons or tool conjured in this way disappear when you stop holding them. You can attune to these weapons or tools when you summon them & you become proficient with them, if you aren't already.

__Cohors Sanguine Awakening (For Aerin after talk with the Founder)__

*You learn about how the Founder's Cohors Sanguine were normally awakened (become able to survive the Cohors Sanguine ritual) and he shares with you the realization he had when he first feed on a sentient person.*

**Awakening (*Founder Version*)**
Awakening normally happens when a vampire has feed on enough sentient beings to realize the truth of the Founder's curse. That it allows a vampire to consume the divine potential scattered & hidden across mortals.

**Founders Realization**
When the Founder drank the blood of the Sun God’s Son, he tasted divinity for a split second. After the Sun ripped away his divinity and cursed him to become the first vampire, the Founder drank the blood of monsters, but when he first drank the blood of a sentient person, he tasted a fraction of the same power as the divinity. He realized that there is divine potential scattered and hidden across mortal races. He took over a settlement and made it into a city. He built a hierarchy for the sole purpose of accumulating the divine potential at the top of the food chain. The vampires fed on mortals, noble vampires fed on vampires, royalty fed on nobility, and the Founder fed on royalty. With each transaction of blood, infinitesimally small traces pf divinity were transferred to the top predator from the mortals who were at the bottom of the food chain. That’s why he refused every proposal forbidding vampires to feed on vampires. He is trying to achieve divinity because he thinks that he can do a better job than the current deities. He justifies his cruel actions by defending their necessity and he wants to make them right once he becomes a deity.
