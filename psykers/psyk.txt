*Psy-Points*
	The Psyker table shows how many Psy-Points you have to manifests your psyonic abilities. 
	To manifests one of these psyonic abilities, you must expend an amount of Psy-Points stated in the manifestation's description or higher. 
	You regain all expended Psy-Points when you finish a long rest.

*Manifestations Known of 1st Level and Higher*
	You know two 1st-level Manifestation of your choice from the Manifestations list.
	The Manifestations Known column of the Psyker table shows when you learn more Manifestations of your choice. 
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Manifestations you know and replace it with another Manifestations.

*Psy-Casting*
	Constitution and Inteligence are both used to manifest psyonic ability.
	
	When attempting to manifest a psyonic ability, you must first Focus your mind and body to ensure that you don't harm yourself when attempting to manifest a psyonic ability. 
	Before unleashing your psyonic power, make a Constitution check against the focus DC of the chosen psyonic ability. On a success it manifestats as described in its description. On a fail, your Action is wasted, but no Psy-Points are used. Alternatively, you can choose to still manifestat the psyonic ability (and spend the Psy-Points), at the cost of gaining 1 point of Psy-Exhaustion.

	*Psy-Exhaustion*
		Psy-Exhaustion adds to your normal exhaustion, but also reduces your Inteligence by 1 for every point of Psy-Exhaustion you have. 
		However, 1 point of Psy-Exhaustion is removed for every hour you don't attempt to manifest any psyonic abilities.
 
	You use your Inteligence whenever a Manifestation refers to your Psy-Casting Ability. In addition, you use your Inteligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Manifestation when making an attack roll with one.
	
	Psy-Cast save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Inteligence modifier
	Psy-Cast attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Inteligence modifier

*Concentration <Find a new name>*
	As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next Psychic Manifestation roll on the current turn. ou can use this bonus action only if you havenâ€™t moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

*Nullification*
	Psychic abilities can be nullified - thwarted by the mental energies of another.
	When an other psyker attemps to manifest a psyonic ability, you can use your Reaction to attempt to discrupt their Focus roll. 
	You spend a number of Psy-Points of your choosing, if you spend more Psy-Points on your Nullification attempt then the number spend by the other Psyker, their Manifestation fails to manifest and their Psy-Points are wasted.
	If you spent less Psy-Points than the opposing Psyker, you make an Inteligence check equal to 10 + the diffrence in the points
